# gigqo_assignment

That's standard new Flutter project containing Flutter Counter Demo application.

## Goals of assingment

In your branch you need to handle mock-up data from Gigqo beta-api backend server.

API endpoint URL:
https://beta-api.gigqo.com/api


API contains basic REST endpoints implementing CRUD operations:

GET     /mockup/track       List all tracks
GET     /mockup/track/{id}  Get details for specific track
POST    /mockup/track       Create track
PUT     /mockup/track       Update track
DELETE  /mockup/track       Delete Track

For fetching and storing data you can use simple Flutter approach,
but are free to implement or use existing solutions of more advanced
application state management, e.g. Providers, BloC, GetX etc.

Finally your version of App should have corresponding UI to represent
fetched data with at least one extra screen for detailed information
about track.
